# Codetrace

An experiment to use evaluation-based static analysis to simplify symbolic
optimization.

## Requirement

This is very early, experimental work.  In another word, don't use it in your
project.

This has been only tested on **python 3.5**.

The graphs are drawn using the [graphviz](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/graphviz) package.

```
pip install graphviz
```

## Testing

```
py.test
```
